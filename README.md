# Blackjack-Game
## Description
This project is a console-based Blackjack game in Java, simulating the popular casino card game where the objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21.

## Rules
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points each.
- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points.

### Gameplay
1. Each player is dealt two cards, as is the dealer.
2. One of the dealer's cards is dealt face down.
3. Players decide to either:
    - **Hit**: Draw another card.
    - **Stand**: Keep their current hand, and the dealer starts to play.
4. The dealer must draw cards until reaching at least 17.
5. The hand closest to 21 wins.
6. Exceeding 21 results in a bust and a loss of the hand.
